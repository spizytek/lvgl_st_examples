## Introduction
This project has all the necessary parameter set up for the STM32F429I DISCOVERY board to run all examples provided by the LVGL library. LVGL is a free and open-source graphics library that provides everything you need to create embedded GUI applications.

## Hardware Requirements
- STM32F429I DISCOVERY board
- USB cable for programming and power
- Optional: ST-LINK/V2 programmer (if needed)

## Software Requirements
- STM32CubeIDE (or another suitable development environment like Keil or IAR)
- STM32CubeMX
- LVGL library (latest version)
- HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer) drivers for STM32F4 series

## Project Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository
Clone the project repository from GitHub:
```bash
git clone 
```
## Building and Flashing

1. Build the project using STM32CubeIDE.
2. Flash the firmware onto the STM32F429I DISCOVERY board using the built-in ST-LINK programmer.

## Running the Examples

### Running a Specific Example
In `main.c`, include the example you want to run:
```c
#include "lv_examples/lv_tests/lv_test_theme/lv_test_theme_1.h"

int main(void) {
    // System initialization
    lv_test_theme_1();
    while (1) {
        lv_task_handler();
        HAL_Delay(5);
    }
}
```

### Running All Examples
You can create a function to run all examples sequentially.
